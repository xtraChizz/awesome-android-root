## Understanding Root Access

Root access grants **superuser (administrator) privileges** on Android, providing complete control over your device's operating system and hardware.

### What Root Enables

- **System-level control** over files, processes, and hardware
- **Bypass manufacturer restrictions** on any Android version
- **Install powerful apps** requiring deep system integration (see [Root Apps](../apps-and-modules/))
- **Modify core system files** and customize every aspect via Magic Mount, OverlayFS, or KPM
- **Access hidden hardware features** and advanced kernel-level configurations
- **Kernel-level code injection** via APatch KPM (inline-hook, syscall-table-hook)
- **Fine-grained root access control** via KernelSU App Profiles (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux)

### Benefits vs Risks

| Benefits | Risks |
|----------|-------|
| Complete device control | Warranty void (usually permanent) |
| [System-wide ad blocking](../general-guides/android-adblocking.md) | Reduced security if misconfigured |
| [Performance tuning](../apps-and-modules/#performance-and-optimization) | Banking apps require active hiding ([solutions](../troubleshooting.md#play-integrity-and-banking-apps)) |
| Privacy enhancements (firewall, permission control) | OTA updates require manual re-patching |
| [Bloatware removal](../general-guides/android-apps-debloating.md) | Potential for device bricking |
| Full app + data backups (Swift Backup, Neo Backup) | Play Integrity may break unpredictably |
| Kernel-level tweaks (CPU, GPU, scheduler) | Strong Integrity generally unachievable on unlocked devices |
| Custom ROM installation freedom | Bootloader unlock wipes ALL data |

### Is Rooting Right for You?

| **✅ Root If:** | **❌ Don't Root If:** |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Want complete control over your device | Rely solely on banking/finance apps |
| System-wide ad blocking is priority | Uncomfortable with terminal/command-line |
| Enjoy deep customization & theming | Need 100% warranty coverage |
| Privacy & anti-tracking matters | Want seamless automatic OTA updates |
| Willing to learn & troubleshoot | New to Android and risk-averse |
| Use device as daily driver with backups | Prefer stock, zero-maintenance experience |

---

## Prerequisites and Safety

### Critical Warnings

::: danger ⚠️ PERMANENT CONSEQUENCES
**Data Loss** - Unlocking bootloader completely erases all device data. Backup everything before proceeding.

**Warranty Void** - Bootloader unlocking permanently voids manufacturer warranty on most devices.

**Samsung Knox** - Bootloader unlock permanently trips Knox eFuse. Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, Samsung Pass are lost **forever** - even if you re-lock the bootloader.

**Security Risks** - Root access can expose your device to malware if misused. Only grant root to trusted apps. With great power comes great responsibility.

**Banking & Finance Apps** - Many financial apps actively detect root. Play Integrity bypass is a continuous cat-and-mouse game requiring ongoing maintenance.

**Bricking Risk** - Incorrect procedures can permanently damage your device. Follow instructions exactly and have a [recovery plan ready](../troubleshooting.md#emergency-recovery).
:::

### Essential Requirements

**Hardware:**
- Android device with **unlockable bootloader** (verify before starting - some carrier-locked variants cannot be unlocked)
- **50% or higher** battery charge (a dead battery during flashing = brick)
- Quality **data-capable** USB cable (not charge-only cables)
- Computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux - Linux is often the most reliable)

**Software:**
- [Android Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) (ADB/Fastboot) - keep these updated!
- Device-specific USB drivers (Windows only - see [OEM driver list](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb))
- Stock firmware for your device (essential for recovery)
- Backup solution for your data (Swift Backup, Neo Backup, or manual copy)

**Files You'll Need:**
- Stock `boot.img` or `init_boot.img` (extract from your device's firmware - Android 13+ devices typically use `init_boot.img`)
- Latest root solution APK/ZIP (Magisk, KernelSU, or APatch)
- Custom recovery image (optional but recommended)

**Knowledge:**
- Basic command line / terminal familiarity
- Understanding of your exact device model and variant
- Ability to research and follow instructions carefully
- Emergency recovery plan (know how to flash stock firmware)

### Pre-Rooting Checklist

1. ✅ **Backup all data** - Photos, contacts, messages, app data (see [Backup Apps](../apps-and-modules/#backup-and-restore))
2. ✅ **Charge device** - Minimum 50% battery
3. ✅ **Verify bootloader unlockability** - Check OEM Unlocking toggle in Developer Options (greyed out = likely carrier-locked)
4. ✅ **Download necessary files** - Stock firmware, root solution (APK+ZIP), recovery image
5. ✅ **Research your device** - Read XDA forums and device-specific guides thoroughly
6. ✅ **Prepare recovery plan** - Know how to restore stock firmware via fastboot/recovery
7. ✅ **Identify correct partition** - Determine if your device uses `boot.img` or `init_boot.img` (Android 13+ typically = `init_boot.img`)

## Choosing a Root Method

Three primary rooting solutions exist, each with distinct advantages and trade-offs. **Magisk** offers the broadest compatibility and largest ecosystem, **KernelSU** provides kernel-level root with granular app control, and **APatch** combines kernel patching with module support.

### Quick Comparison

| Feature | Magisk | KernelSU | APatch |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Guide** | [Magisk Guide](./magisk-guide.md) | [KernelSU Guide](./kernelsu-guide.md) | [APatch Guide](./apatch-guide.md) |
| **Target Users** | Beginners, most users | GKI devices, privacy-focused | Developers, edge cases |
| **Architecture** | Systemless (boot/init_boot/vendor_boot) | Kernel-level (GKI/LKM) | Kernel patching (KernelPatch) |
| **Android Support** | Android 6.0+ | GKI 2.0 (kernel 5.10+) | ARM64, kernel 3.18+ |
| **Installation** | Easy (patch & flash) | Moderate (needs compatible kernel) | Moderate (ARM64 only) |
| **Module Ecosystem** | 1000+ Magisk modules | Modified Magisk modules via metamodule | APModule + KPM (kernel-level) |
| **Module Mounting** | Built-in Magic Mount | Metamodule required | Magic Mount default; OverlayFS optional |
| **Root Hiding** | Good (DenyList + Shamiko + PIF) | Excellent (app profiles, uid/gid/selinux control) | Good (SuperKey credential system) |
| **Community** | Largest | Growing | Small |
| **Development** | Active | Very active | Active |
| **Unique Strength** | Ecosystem & broad compatibility | Kernel space, only permitted apps see su | KPM kernel code injection without source |
| **OTA Handling** | Re-patch after OTA | Some OTA flows survive via LKM | Initial A/B OTA support |

### Decision Guide

**Choose Magisk if:**
- You are new to rooting and want the easiest path
- You need maximum module compatibility
- You want universal device support across Android versions
- You prefer in-app updates and the largest community

**Choose KernelSU if:**
- Your device runs a GKI kernel (5.10+) and you want kernel-level security
- Fine-grained app profiles (uid, gid, groups, capabilities, SELinux) matter to you
- You want the best root concealment (only permitted apps can see `su`)
- You're comfortable with metamodule setup for module support

**Choose APatch if:**
- Magisk/KernelSU are blocked on your specific firmware
- You need kernel-level code injection (KPM) without kernel source
- Your device is ARM64 with a compatible kernel
- You want both Magisk-like modules AND kernel patching

## Universal Rooting Process

All Android devices follow this four-step rooting process, regardless of manufacturer or root method. Modern devices (Android 13+) often use `init_boot.img` instead of `boot.img` for root patching - check your device specifics.

### Step 1: Unlock Bootloader

Unlocking the bootloader is the essential first step that enables all subsequent modifications.

**Quick Steps:**
1. **Enable Developer Options** (Settings > About > Tap Build Number 7 times)
2. **Enable OEM Unlocking** (Developer Options > OEM Unlocking)
3. **Enable USB Debugging** (Developer Options > USB Debugging)
4. **Boot to fastboot mode** (Power + Volume Down or `adb reboot bootloader`)
5. **Execute unlock command** (`fastboot flashing unlock` or `fastboot oem unlock`)

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ This step **erases ALL data**. Backup everything first. On Samsung devices, this also **permanently trips Knox** (Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, Samsung Pass lost forever).

**[📖 Complete Bootloader Unlocking Guide](./how-to-unlock-bootloader.md)**

### Step 2: Install Custom Recovery (Optional but Recommended)

Custom recovery provides advanced features and safer modification workflows. While not strictly required for all modern root methods, it's invaluable for backups and emergency recovery.

**Popular Options:**
- **TWRP** - Most widely supported, active development
- **OrangeFox** - Modern UI, frequent updates, EROFS support
- **SKYHAWK** - Feature-rich recovery project
- **PitchBlack** - Based on TWRP with enhanced features

**Process:**
1. **Download device-specific recovery image**
2. **Boot to fastboot mode**
3. **Flash recovery image** - `fastboot flash recovery recovery.img`
4. **Boot to recovery** - Test functionality before proceeding

> [!NOTE]
> Some modern devices (especially A/B partition schemes) may not have a dedicated recovery partition. In these cases, you can `fastboot boot recovery.img` to temporarily boot recovery without flashing.

**[📖 Custom Recovery Installation Guide](./how-to-install-custom-recovery.md)**

### Step 3: Install Root Solution

Choose and install your preferred root method. The modern approach uses boot image patching.

#### Option A: Magisk (Recommended for Most Users)

1. Download latest **Magisk APK** from [official GitHub](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases)
2. Extract the correct image from your device's stock firmware:
   - **Android 13+ (most devices):** `init_boot.img`
   - **Android 12 and older:** `boot.img`
   - **Some Samsung devices:** `boot.img` + `vendor_boot.img` (Magisk v30.3+)
3. Transfer image to device, patch it using the Magisk app
4. Flash patched image via fastboot (`fastboot flash init_boot magisk_patched...img`)
5. Reboot and complete Magisk app setup

> [!TIP]
> Magisk now supports XZ-compressed modules and 16k page size devices. Use the latest stable release from [GitHub](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases).

**[📖 Complete Magisk Guide](./magisk-guide.md)**

#### Option B: KernelSU

1. Verify your device has a **GKI-compatible kernel** (kernel 5.10+ with GKI 2.0)
2. Download KernelSU-supported kernel for your device or use LKM (Loadable Kernel Module) mode
3. Flash kernel via fastboot or KernelSU app
4. Install **KernelSU Manager** app
5. Install a **metamodule** (meta-overlayfs or Meta-Hybrid Mount) - required for modules to work
6. Configure App Profiles for fine-grained root access control

> [!WARNING]
> KernelSU **no longer has built-in module mounting**. Fresh installations require a metamodule for modules to function. See the [KernelSU Guide](./kernelsu-guide.md) for details.

**[📖 Complete KernelSU Guide](./kernelsu-guide.md)**

#### Option C: APatch

1. Verify device compatibility (ARM64, kernel 3.18–6.12)
2. Download **APatch Manager** and prepare your stock `boot.img`
3. Patch boot image via APatch app (set a strong SuperKey)
4. Flash patched image via fastboot
5. Configure APatch Manager and install APModule/KPM as needed

> [!NOTE]
> APatch combines Magisk's convenient boot.img install with KernelSU's kernel patching power. KPM allows kernel function inline-hook and syscall-table-hook without kernel source.

**[📖 Complete APatch Guide](./apatch-guide.md)**

### Step 4: Post-Root Configuration

After successful root installation, complete these essential steps:

1. **Verify Root Access** - Use a root checker app to confirm superuser access works
2. **Install Essential Apps** - Visit [Starter Kit: Must-Have Apps](../apps-and-modules/#starter-kit-must-have-apps)
3. **Configure Root Hiding** (critical for banking apps):
   - **Magisk:** Enable Zygisk + DenyList, install [Play Integrity Fix](https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix) + [Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore) + [Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io) (or open-source [Zygisk Assistant](https://github.com/snake-4/Zygisk-Assistant))
   - **KernelSU:** Use App Profiles, install Zygisk Next + PIF + Tricky Store
   - **APatch:** Use SuperKey credential system + PIF modules
4. **Create Full Backup** - Use Swift Backup, Neo Backup, or recovery nandroid

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Device Won't Boot (Bootloop)**

Symptoms: Device stuck on boot logo, constantly rebooting

Solutions:
1. Boot to recovery mode (Power + Volume Up, varies by device)
2. Wipe cache partition from recovery
3. Restore from backup if available
4. Flash stock `boot.img` / `init_boot.img` via fastboot to undo root
5. Flash full stock firmware via fastboot/recovery
6. Seek help on your device-specific XDA forum

**Root Not Detected**

Symptoms: Root checker shows no root, apps can't get superuser access

Solutions:
1. Verify root manager app is installed and running
2. Check if Zygisk is enabled (Magisk settings)
3. Grant root permission when prompted by apps
4. Re-patch and re-flash boot image
5. Verify the patched image wasn't overwritten by an OTA

**Banking Apps Not Working (Play Integrity)**

Symptoms: Apps detect root and refuse to run, Play Integrity check fails

> [!WARNING]
> Play Integrity bypass is a **cat-and-mouse game** - Google continuously updates detection. No solution is permanent.

Solutions (2026 best practices):
1. **Magisk:** Enable Zygisk → Configure DenyList (add banking app) → Enforce DenyList
2. Install **[Play Integrity Fix](https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix)** module (provides working device fingerprint)
3. Install **[Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore)** for advanced key attestation spoofing
4. Install **[Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io)** (closed-source) or **[Zygisk Assistant](https://github.com/snake-4/Zygisk-Assistant)** (open-source) for better root hiding
5. Hide the Magisk app (Settings → Hide the Magisk app → repackage with random name)
6. Use **[Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext)** (alternative Zygisk implementation, works on KernelSU too)
7. Clear banking app data after setting up hiding
8. See [detailed Play Integrity troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md#play-integrity-and-banking-apps)

> [!NOTE]
> **Strong Integrity** (required by some wallet/payment apps) is generally **not achievable** on unlocked bootloaders. Even with all fixes, some apps may refuse to run. Consider using a secondary unrooted device for critical banking.

**OTA Updates Failing**

Symptoms: System updates fail to install or cause bootloop

Solutions:
1. **Magisk:** Use "Restore Images" in Magisk app before OTA, then "Install to Inactive Slot" after OTA
2. Flash full OTA package manually, then re-patch and re-flash root
3. **KernelSU:** Some OTA flows survive via LKM mode, but verify after each update
4. **APatch:** Initial A/B OTA support available (experimental)
5. Consider switching to a custom ROM with built-in OTA + root support

**Fastboot Not Recognized**

Symptoms: Computer doesn't detect device in fastboot mode

Solutions:
1. Install proper [USB drivers](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb) (Windows)
2. Try a USB 2.0 port (USB 3.0 often causes issues with fastboot)
3. Use a high-quality data-capable USB cable (not charge-only)
4. On Linux: add udev rules, run `fastboot` as root or configure permissions
5. Try `fastboot devices` on a different computer

### Emergency Recovery

**Safe Mode (Disable All Modules)**

- **Vector (Recommended):** [GitHub](https://github.com/JingMatrix/Vector) - Fully open-source (GPLv3), actively maintained, supports Android 8.1–17 Beta
- **LSPosed (Closed-Source):** [lsposed.zip](https://lsposed.zip/) - Original team's builds, API 101 stable
- Requires Zygisk (Magisk) or Zygisk Next/NeoZygisk (KernelSU)
- Enables Xposed modules for per-app customization, privacy, and UI tweaks
- API 101 is the current standard; Vector CI builds already support it

> [!IMPORTANT]
> See our [Complete Vector/LSPosed Guide](./lsposed-guide.md) for the full breakdown on choosing between Vector (open-source) and lsposed.zip (closed-source), installation, and module management.

**Custom ROM Installation**

Replace stock Android with privacy-focused custom ROMs:
- Requires unlocked bootloader and typically custom recovery
- Popular options: LineageOS, PixelOS, crDroid, GrapheneOS (now supports Zygisk Next)
- Reduces telemetry, removes bloatware, extends device lifespan
