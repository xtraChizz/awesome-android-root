## Understanding Bootloaders

The bootloader is your device's startup manager - the first program that runs when powering on, responsible for loading the operating system and enforcing security policies.

### Why Unlock Your Bootloader?

**Unlocking enables:**
- **Custom recovery installation** (TWRP, OrangeFox)
- **Root access** via Magisk, KernelSU
- **Custom ROM installation** (LineageOS, GrapheneOS)
- **Kernel modifications** for performance tuning
- **Advanced system modifications** and tweaks

### Locked vs Unlocked

| Locked Bootloader | Unlocked Bootloader |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Maximum security | Full customization freedom |
| OTA updates work seamlessly | Can install custom ROMs |
| Banking apps work normally | Can install custom recovery |
| Cannot install custom software | Root access possible |
| Limited modification | Warranty void (usually) |

---

## Prerequisites

### ⚠️ Critical Warnings

::: danger IRREVERSIBLE CONSEQUENCES
**Data Erasure** - Unlocking bootloader completely wipes all data. Backup everything before proceeding.

**Warranty Void** - Most manufacturers permanently void warranty. Some devices show permanent unlock warnings.

**Banking Apps** - Many financial apps detect unlocked bootloaders and refuse to work.

**Device Security** - Unlocked bootloaders reduce device security. Physical access can compromise data.
:::

### Essential Requirements

**Hardware**
- Android device with unlockable bootloader
- 50% or higher battery charge
